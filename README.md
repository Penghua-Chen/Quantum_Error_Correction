All documents in this repository are Jupyter notebooks designed to guide you draw and simulate quantum circuits step by step.
The platform used here is Qiskit, and the most famous repository is "Qiskit / textbook", which is upgraded to https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/ by John Watrous.


The quantum circuits used in this repository are adapted from Wikipedia. For further reading, Shorâ€™s original paper provides a direct and accessible explanation of the code. In contrast, the textbook Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang takes a more abstract approach, using this code as a foundation to introduce the stabilizer formalism and generalize to broader classes of quantum error-correcting codes.
