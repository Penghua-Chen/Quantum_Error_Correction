All documents in this repository are Jupyter notebooks designed to guide you draw and simulate quantum circuits step by step.
The platform used here is Qiskit, and the most famous repository is "Qiskit / textbook", which is upgraded to [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) by John Watrous.


The quantum circuits used in this repository are adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction). For further reading, [Shorâ€™s original paper](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc670.052/pR2493_1.pdf) provides a direct and accessible explanation of the code. In contrast, [Nielsen and Chuang's textbook](https://profmcruz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-nielsen-chuang.pdf) takes a more abstract approach, using this code as a foundation to introduce the stabilizer formalism and generalize to broader classes of quantum error-correcting codes.
